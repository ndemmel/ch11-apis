The "cars" dataset includes information about the relationship between the 
speed a car is going in miles per hour and the distance in feet that it takes
the car to stop. This data was recorded in 1920. There are 50 observations.

```{r}
library(knitr)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r} 
source("analysis.R")
```

## Histogram for the frequency of the cars' speeds

```{r, echo=FALSE}
make_hist()
```


The mean speed is `r mean_speed`. 

```{r}
names(cars_styled) <- c("Speed", "Distance to Stop")
cars_styled %>% kable()
```
